This was very interesting to create. The biggest problem I faced was getting the image files to actually link up in the js script. changed the code several times finally got it to work correctly. It was definately a time consuming challenge to get it all put together. I tried creating a folder for this class, with the repositories in that folder, but couldnt get it to deploy correctly that way.
